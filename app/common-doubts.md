# API Reference

## Helper Methods

The following methods are globally importable from `vitepress` and are typically used in custom theme Vue components. However, they are also usable inside `.md` pages because markdown files are compiled into Vue single-file components.

Methods that start with `use*` indicates that it is a [Vue 3 Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) function that can only be used inside `setup()` or `<script setup>`.
